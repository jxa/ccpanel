h1. ccpanel

ccpanel is a GTK clone of ccmenu, which is Mac only. It periodically polls your CruiseControl.rb server to determine your current build status, then displays an indicator in the status panel.

h3. Requirements

ruby-gnome2 - On debian/ubuntu you can do 'sudo apt-get install ruby-gnome2' (i think... still need to verify)

libnotify && notify-send - for pop-up notifications you need to have the libnotify and notify-send packages installed. 

h3. Notes

At the moment, only https with basic auth is supported because that is the setup I have. If you would like to see other options either wait a couple of weeks until I get around to it, or email me to kick my ass into gear.

I used the images from the ccmenu project for my initial set of icons.

h3. Install

 sudo apt-get install ruby-gnome2

 # if you want 'growl' pop-up notifications
 sudo apt-get install libnotify-bin

 git clone git://github.com/jxa/ccpanel.git 
 nohup ruby ccpanel/src/ccpanel.rb &
