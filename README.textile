h1. ccpanel

_ccpanel_ is a GTK clone of "ccmenu":http://ccmenu.sourceforge.net/, a Mac-only CruiseControl monitoring widget. It periodically polls your CruiseControl.rb server to determine your current build status, then displays an indicator in the status panel.

h3. Notes

At the moment, only https with basic auth is supported because that is the setup I have. If you would like to see other options either wait a couple of weeks until I get around to it, or email me to kick my ass into gear.

I used the images from the ccmenu project for my initial set of icons.

h3. Install

# sudo apt-get install ruby-gnome2
# sudo apt-get install libnotify-bin (if you want 'growl' pop-up notifications)
# git clone git://github.com/jxa/ccpanel.git 
# ruby ccpanel/src/ccpanel.rb &
